## 04.10.2024  week 1 term 1

It's been quite a while since I updated my journal. This is my first week as a postgraduate at Warwick, and the module selection session has just finished. I’m excited by the fresh feeling of starting at a new school, but the pressure is setting in with the modules I’ve chosen.

What’s really giving me a headache is my limited vocabulary. I’m keen to focus on analog circuits, so I’ve selected modules that suit this, like **Microwave Engineering and RF Circuits**, where I’ll need to design an RF circuit. This is a great opportunity to enhance my knowledge.

I also chose **ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and MEMS (Microelectromechanical Systems)** modules. For these, I’ll be reading additional books, focusing on analog circuits and using Cadence Virtuoso to design integrator and differentiator amplifiers. I’m finding it all quite challenging. 🥲   But with great pressure comes great achievement. I hope I can manage my time well and succeed!!!
