I don't know why I'm  feeling so depressed. Maybe it's because i have no clear idea about my futhure, especially after graduating from university. Just a few days ago, I was dreaming of starting my own business with passion, but today, all those dreams feel like they're kust bubbles waiting to burst.

where is my future? In which direction should i go? I feel like such a failure as a graduate. I invested so much in my education, but in this difficult economic and societial climate, it all feels like a waste.

Now i realize that "PASSION" is a beautiful word, but it often  feels like cruel illusion.......
