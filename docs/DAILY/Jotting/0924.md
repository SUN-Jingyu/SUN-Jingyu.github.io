Yesterday, I reviewed my third-year module on Active Circuits 4, but I still feel like I haven't gained much from it. It's been over a year since I took the module, and I still haven't mastered operational amplifiers. Today, I'm sitting in front of my laptop, feeling frustrated and wondering why I struggle so much with retaining what I've learned in university. I'm feeling really sad and depressed about it.
