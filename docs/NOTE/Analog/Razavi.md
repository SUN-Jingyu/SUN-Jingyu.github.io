## 信号的完成性和匹配 Signal Integrity and Matching 

> Why do we need to analysis input and output impedance in analog circuit?

* __Input Impedance__: The input impedance of a circuit determines *how much of the input signal is absorbed by the circuit*. If the input impedance is too low compared to the source impedance(源阻抗), a significant *portion of the signal will be lost*, leading to signal attenuation.

* __Output Impedance__: The output impedance affects *how the circuit drives a load (负载)*. If the ouput impedance is not well-matched to the load impedance, *signal reflection or losses can occur*, especially in *high-frequency application*.

* __Impdance Matching__: In many analog cirits, especially in RF and audio aplications, impedae matching is essential to ensure *maximum power transfer* and *mnimize reflections*.
